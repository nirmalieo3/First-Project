 <h3 id="headline"><em>There are four groups of Biological Molecules.<em></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Carbohydrates</strong></li>
<p>Carbohydrates are made up of carbon (C), hydrogen (H) and oxygen (O) atoms.
  They are used for storing energy in living organisms.
 Plants store carbohydrates as starch and human and animal store 
as glycogen.</p>
<li><strong>Lipids</strong></li>
<p>Lipids are made of C,H,and O.It gives more energy than carbohydrate.</p>
<li><strong>Protein</strong></li>
<p>Proteins represent the structural composition of all living organisms.</p>
<li><strong>Nuclic acids</strong></li>
<p>There are two types of nucleic acids: ribonucleic acid (RNA)
 and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)</p>
</ul>
<blockquote>
 

<cite>---Nuclic acids are responsible for genetic traits</cite>
